<!-- 
At this revision the viewpoints that are defined by annotations are implemented
by copying the x3d field values into either the iiif-perspective-viewpoint or 
iiif-orthographic-viewpoint nodes defind here. This is because a viewpoint or 
orthoviewpoint created and added to the scene by javascript are not responding
correctly to set_bind = true events.
